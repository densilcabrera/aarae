function  OUT = irs(n,cycles,fs)
% This function is used to generate an inverse repeated repeated sequence
% (IRS), made from a maximum length sequence signal (mls), which can be
% used to measure impulse responses.
%
% The IRS signal consists of an MLS signal repeated once, with all even
% samples multiplied by -1. The n input argument (or first field of the
% dialog box) determines the bit length of the MLS signal (note that the
% IRS signal is double the length of the MLS signal used). The number of
% samples in one cycle of the IRS signal is 2*(2^n-1).
%
%
% This function calls code by M.R.P. Thomas  - please refer to
% the following folder AARAE/Generators/Noise/mls, which contains his code,
% documentation and license.
%
% The function outputs the IRS sequence (in the audio field), together with
% the time-reversed IRS signal (as audio2). The signal is time reversed for
% compatability with the general use of audio2 as an inverse filter.
% However, you should not normally use AARAE's '*' button (which convolves
% audio with audio2) to obtain the impulse response, although it will
% probably still work to an extent, because it does linear convolution
% rather than the required circular convolution (or cross-correlation with
% the non-reversed signal). Instead use the processor CircXcorrforIR to
% derive the impulse response, which is in AARAE's Cross & auto functions
% folder (in Processors).
